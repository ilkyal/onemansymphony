He says: When you think about a work of art, the medium and its music should be remembered as a whole instead of one part being seen as a simple accompaniment.">

        <h1 class="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <h2>━ Do you do commissions? Can I hire you for my project? How much does a song cost?</h2>
        <p class="push-it">Yes, I do commission work. You can find more information about the subject and the prices by visiting <a class="just-underline-from-right"  href="/about.html">the About page here.</a></p>

        <h2>━ I see that your paid content is only available on Unreal Marketplace and Unity Asset Store. Is there any other way of buying these packs?</h2>
        <p class="push-it">Yes. You can go to my <a class="just-underline-from-right" target="_blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/onemansymphony">Patreon page</a> and make a one-time-donation worth of the album that you want to buy and message me directly about the album. Then you'll receive a download link that'll be valid for 14 days. Normally, Patreon does not allow one-time-donations but <a class="just-underline-from-right" target="_blank" href="https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/204606215-Can-I-make-a-one-time-payment-">as explained here</a> on the official Patreon blog, you can subscribe to one of my tiers and after the payment went through, you can cancel your subscription. You can check the prices of my paid albums on <a class="just-underline-from-right" target="_blank" href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/One+Man+Symphony?count=20&sortBy=effectiveDate&sortDir=DESC&start=0">Unreal Marketplace</a>  or <a class="just-underline-from-right"  target="_blank" href="https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/47417"> Unity Asset Store.</a> To make a one-time-donation, go to <a class="just-underline-from-right" target="_blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/onemansymphony">Patreon</a>. You'll see a tier called "Support One Man Symphony's Music" as listed with $9.99 tag. When you click on the join button, it'll ask you how much you want to donate. Then you can enter the amount of the price of the album that you want to buy. A short time after, the amount that you entered in will be deducted from your account. Then you can cancel your subscription. You can send me a message on Patreon after that or wait for me to contact you.</p>

        <h2>━ Can I use your free songs hosted on Bandcamp on my personal and commercial projects?</h2>
        <p class="push-it">Yes, you can use my free songs that I'm hosting on Bandcamp currently in any of your personal and commercial projects. You can use them in your movies, games, apps, streams, podcasts... Simply in any medium you can think of. They're all free to download and use but you must provide appropriate credit. You can learn about giving appropriate credits in the following question. The only limitation here is that you can not sell my songs directly under any condition and you can not use them <u>without a credit</u> if you're not a supporter of my free music project.</p>

        <h2>━ How can/should I give credit to you?</h2>
        <p class="push-it">If you're using my paid content (such as the albums hosted on Unreal Marketplace and Unity Asset Store), you do not need to provide any credits. Patrons who support my free music project also do not need to provide any credit. If you're not a supporter and want to use my songs in your personal and commercial projects, you should put the following info in the description or the ending section of the medium that you're going to use the songs in: Composed by: One Man Symphony - <a class="just-underline-from-right" href="https://www.onemansymphony.com/">onemansymphony.com</a></p>

        <h2>━ Some of the albums are paid and some of them are free. Why is that?</h2>
        <p class="push-it">Quality-wise, there is no difference between the paid and the free albums. I put the same hours and the same amount of work into both of them. I'm a professional composer and that's how I make a living. To generate income, I need to release some of my work with a price tag on them. That's simply why I have paid albums. About the free ones: In the past, I've been creating my own scenes in Unreal Engine and sometimes I would need additional assets to reckon how a scene would end up looking. And I've seen that a bunch of people were sharing their assets under the CC license so you could download them and you could have an idea of how your scene would play out after the final arrangements. During this process, I realized that if you needed background music to test your scenes, it was very difficult to find high quality music. It was relatively easy to find 8-bit sounding tracks but if you wanted anything different than that, you would run out of your luck pretty soon. So give back to the community, since then I've been releasing some of my albums under the CC license so people could download and use them for free as long as they provide an attribution.</p>

        <h2>━What's the benefit of being a Patreon supporter?</h2>
        <p class="push-it">Supporters of my free music project (the albums hosted on Bandcamp) do not need to provide any credits if they are using my songs in their projects. Additionally, I use the donations that I get through Patreon to invest in more instruments so I can record more various and high quality tracks.</p>

        <h2>━ Where can I find the license information about the songs hosted on Bandcamp?</h2>
        <p class="push-it">All of the albums I've uploaded to Bandcamp are released under the CC BY 4.0 license. You can find more information about it <a class="just-underline-from-right" target="_blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ ">here.</a> If I need to simplify it, as long as you give a credit back to me you can do whatever you want with these songs except for selling them.</p>

        <h2>━ Do I need to download the free songs from Bandcamp if I want to use them in my streams?</h2>
        <p class="push-it">Yes and no. Some of my songs are available on Spotify so you could stream them through <a class="just-underline-from-right" target="_blank"  href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2thNcRskFqUVCvEZnjrSGl?si=Ux5SUwT6RJWBsbpIZA08Cg&dl_branch=1">Spotify</a> during your streams but not all of them are available there.</p>

        <h2>━ If I play your free songs during my stream or use them in my Youtube videos, will I get a copyright strike?</h2>
        <p class="push-it">All of my songs are stream-cleared so as long as you provide a credit back, no, you will not get hit by a copyright strike or anything like that.</p>

        <h2>━ I am not a fan of Patreon. Is there another way of supporting your free music project?</h2>
        <p class="push-it">At the moment I accept donations only through Patreon but you can always spread the word about my music and listen to them on Spotify so I would get more exposure.</p>

        <h2>━ Can I remix your songs or modify some parts of them to use them as sound effects?</h2>
        <p class="push-it">Yes. You can remix my songs or modify them as long as an attribution is provided back to me.</p>

        <h2>━ Can I use your songs on my Twitch/Youtube/Instagram/Tiktok/Radio/etc channel?</h2>
        <p class="push-it">You can use my songs anywhere you want as long as an attribution is provided back to me.</p>

        <h2>━ I have a question that I can not find the answer of it here. How can I contact you?</h2>
        <p class="push-it">You can write an email to the following address and your question will be answered in 3 business days: music@onemansymphony.com</p>
